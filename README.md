How to Play

2. Control your character using the 'arrow' keys, 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right.' You can move one tile at a time, and you cannot move diagonally.

3. Try to reach the water without getting hit by a bug. When you reach the water, you will progress to the next level. Levels are kept track of on the scoreboard on the left, as are number of losses. Number of lives are located in the bottom right.

4. With each level upgrade, an obstacle is added. Avoid them as well. At level four, a lawn mower is added so the grass is no longer safe. You can get an extra life at level 5. 

5. When you run out of lives, a Game Over screen will appear.

6. The goal is to get to level 10, and a prize and 'Winner's Screen' will be presented.
